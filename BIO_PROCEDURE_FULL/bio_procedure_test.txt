Recently	O

it	O

that	O

the	O

While	O
previous	O
research	O

focused	O
on	O
phase	O
coupling	O
as	O
a	O
correlate	O
of	O
cortical	O

more	O
recent	O
findings	O
indicated	O
that	O
additional	O

might	O
coexist	O
and	O
possibly	O
subserve	O
distinct	O
cortical	O
functions	O

Here	O
,	O
we	O
studied	O
two	O
coupling	O
modes	O
,	O
namely	O
phase	O
and	O
envelope	O
coupling	O
,	O
which	O
might	O
differ	O
in	O
their	O
origins	O
,	O
putative	O
functions	O
and	O

Therefore	O
,	O
we	O
recorded	O
128-channel	O

the	O

for	O

Our	O
results	O
indicate	O
that	O
gamma-band	O
phase	O
coupling	O
in	O
extrastriate	O
visual	O
cortex	O
might	O
mediate	O
the	O
integration	O

a	O

stimulus	O
during	O

Furthermore	O

our	O
results	O
suggest	O
that	O
long-range	O
fronto-occipital	O
gamma-band	O
envelope	O
coupling	O
sustains	O
the	O
horizontal	O

Additionally	O
,	O
our	O
results	O
support	O
the	O
idea	O
that	O
local	O
parieto-occipital	O
alpha-band	O
phase	O
coupling	O
controls	O
the	O
inter-	O
hemispheric	O
information	O

These	O
findings	O
provide	O
correlative	O
evidence	O
for	O
the	O
notion	O
that	O
synchronized	O

the	O

that	O

that	O
the	O
