Seligman	O

The	O

the	O

Passivity	O
in	O

It	O
is	O
the	O
default	O
,	O
unlearned	O
response	O
to	O
prolonged	O
aversive	O
events	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
mediated	O
by	O
the	O
serotonergic	O
activity	O
of	O
the	O
dorsal	O
raphe	O
nucleus	O
,	O
which	O
in	O

inhibits	O

This	O
passivity	O
can	O
be	O
overcome	O
by	O
learning	O
control	O

with	O
the	O
activity	O
of	O

So	O
animals	O
learn	O
that	O

control	O
aversive	O

but	O
the	O
passive	O
