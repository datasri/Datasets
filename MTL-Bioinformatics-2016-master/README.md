# READMe

This repository contains the models and supplementary data for the paper *A Neural Network Multi-Task Learning Approach to Biomedical Named Entity Recognition* by *Gamal Crichton, Sampo Pyysalo, Billy Chiu* and *Anna Korhonen*.  

The supplementary data can be found in the file *Additional file 1.pdf*.  

The corpora used for the experiments (which can be re-distributed) are in the **data** folder.  
**Note:** The re-distribution status of the BioCreative IV Chemical and Drug (BC4CHEMD) named entity recognition task corpus is unclear but it can be publicly accessed at http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/biocreative-v/track-3-cdr/.

The models can be found in the **models** folder.  

There are several files in the models folder:
+ baseline.py: The MLP model used as a baseline for the experiments.

   *Example Usage*: python baseline.py 'path/to/dataset' 'path/to/vectorfile'

+ baseline_config.py: The configurable variables and their values for the MLP baseline model (baseline.py).
+ config.py: The configurable variables and their values for the convolutional models.
+ MT-dependent.py: The multi-task Dependent Model.

   *Example usage:* python MT-dependent.py 'path/to/data-files'  'dataset-1,...,dataset-*n*'  'path/to/vectorfile'
+ multi-output_MT.py: The multi-output multi-task model.

   *Example usage:* python multi-output_MT.py 'path/to/data-files' 'dataset-1,...,dataset-*n*' 'path/to/vectorfile'
+ multi-output_MT-var-dataset.py: The model used in the multi-task experiments which investigated the effect of multi-task learning on datasets of various sizes.  
Specify the *percent-keep* command to determine how much of the training examples of dataset whose size you wish to vary to randomly keep. This **must** be the first dataset specified, all other datasets will train with full training data.

   *Example usage:* python multi-output_MT-var-dataset.py --percent-keep 0.5 'path/to/data-files' 'path/to/**reduced**-dataset,path/to/**whole**-dataset' 'path/to/vectorfile'
+ single_task.py: The single task model.

   *Example usage:* python single_task.py 'path/to/dataset' 'path/to/vectorfile'

**Note:** The experiments in the paper applied the Viterbi algorithm to the outputs. Use the --viterbi flag to replicate this.
